= Configuring internal clients to trust the cluster CA 

This procedure will show you how to configure a Kafka client that is inside the {ProductPlatformName} cluster (that is, connecting to the `tls` listener on port 9093) so that it trusts the cluster CA certificate.

The easiest way to achieve this for an internal client is to use a volume mount to access the `Secrets` containing the necessary certificates and keys.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator up and running.
* An `Kafka` resource within the {ProductPlatformName} cluster.
* A Kafka client application inside the {ProductPlatformName} cluster which will connect using TLS and needs to trust the cluster CA certificate.

.Procedure

. When defining the client `Pod`

. The Kafka client has to be configured to trust certificates signed by this CA.
For the Java-based Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams APIs, you can do this by importing the CA certificate into the JVM's truststore using the following `keytool` command:
+
[source,shell]
keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca.crt

. In order to configure the Kafka client, following properties should be specified:

* `security.protocol: SSL` when using TLS for encryption (with or without TLS authentication), or `security.protocol: SASL_SSL` when using SCRAM-SHA authentication over TLS. 
* `ssl.truststore.location`: the truststore location where the certificates were imported.
* `ssl.truststore.password`: the password for accessing the truststore. This property can be omitted if it is not needed by the truststore.
